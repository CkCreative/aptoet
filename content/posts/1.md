title: When Life Delays
---

What will happen when you can't have it all yet,  
After you've struggled and toiled in much sweat;  
When it seems no one cares about all the threat.  

Know there is always a better way,  
Bigger and greater things coming to stay;  
For it's out of love that there's delay.
