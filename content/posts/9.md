title: On Success

To succeed you must make mistakes,  
It means to keep trying and never giving up.  
To make it you need a good reputation,  
A short time might tank trust in you.  

Experience is the roughest of teachers,  
It serves you pre tests and post lessons.  

Keep adjusting your sails to counter the winds  
Avoid comfort and jump  
Commit to your dreams and seek education  
Strategize and keep targets in view.
