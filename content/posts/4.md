When it's free and going around,  
Leap in faith and claim your round.  
When you pick from the reserve,  
Come forward though none did observe.

He knows when assets reduce,  
Who owns and oversees the produce.  
Do not ignore or overlook,  
As a witness you also took.

You'll have all the peace and freedom,  
For receiving openly from God's Kingdom.  
The chariot of gifts goes on,  
So others also might get a portion.

The resilient and true friends,  
Will help you through all fences.  
They are innovative and resourceful,  
To let you win favors and be joyful.
