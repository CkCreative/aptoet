You toil for success and to be outstanding,  
But do you find joy and rejoycing?  
You earn the crown you're always admiring,  
The crown lasts forever or is it perishing?  

The crown of happiness that lasts forever,  
All glorious and shining you could endeavour;  
For in that final celebration of favour,  
Will enjoy righteousness in splendor.  

And yours is the crown of life.
